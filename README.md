#FileFinder
## Overview
The FileFinder script is a Python tool designed to search through all available drives on a Windows system for files with a specific extension. It then compiles a list of these files along with their full paths into a text file named result.txt.

## Usage
1. Open the script.
2. Customize the file_extension variable to the desired file extension (e.g., 'jpg', 'txt', etc.).
Run the script.
3. The generated result.txt file will contain the paths of all files with the specified extension found across all available drives.
